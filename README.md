# AVIToast
Toast is just a simple and an elegant way to show small and intutive messages to user about the things they should do and things they show not. These messages are non interactive and are displayed on a specific position on the screen. These messages can appear on screen with a different types of animation, being Fade-In is the most common (as in Android).
